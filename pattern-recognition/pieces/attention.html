                <p>In this piece, the fundamental dynamics of attention are rendered visible through the interaction of particles and force fields. The visualization explores attention not as a static spotlight, but as an oscillating dance between amplification and inhibition â€“ a pattern that persists across scales from neural networks to consciousness itself.</p>
                <p>Luminous fields pulse with varying rhythms, creating zones of attraction and repulsion that mirror the way attention simultaneously enhances and suppresses information. Particles flow through these fields like thoughts or signals, their movements shaped by the shifting landscapes of attention. Some are caught in the gravity of an attention field, while others break free into spaces of diffuse awareness.</p>
                <p>The subtle color transitions between warm and cool tones reflect the dual nature of attention: the warm, focusing force that draws elements into clarity, and the cool, inhibitory force that allows others to recede. This interplay creates ever-evolving patterns that never exactly repeat, much like the dynamic nature of attention itself.</p>
